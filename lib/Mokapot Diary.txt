1)	Started by simply running everything on the server to see what happens. 
	Application crashed as remote objects cannot draw to images on the client.
	Needed to split the update and draw methods into separate classes.
	Took 30 mins to separate methods.
	Got a Mokapot error.
	Looked through some of the guide and realise that final/private objects cannot be returned by remote objects.
