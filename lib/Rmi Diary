RMI Diary
- setup interfaces for remote classes 30 mins
- got ClassNotFoundException, resolved by starting rmiregistry in the bin folder
- got UnmarshalException, resolved by adding throws RemoteException; to all methods in Remote interfaces
- got ClassCastException, resolved by casting to the class interface rather than the class itself
